# CDSS4PCP

Our investigation will develop publicly accessible, reusable, upper-level clinical decision support (CDS) ontology and machine-interpretable CDS rules for CDC-recommended immunization schedules, which will save duplicate effort by multiple stakeholders of CDS rules and build a critical foundation for achieving interoperability for individualsâ€™ immunization records. Our investigation also aims to enable primary care providers, especially in small primary care practices, to manage and maintain CDS rules independently to keep CDS updated, useful, and working to its full potential and to benefit the large population served by such practices.
