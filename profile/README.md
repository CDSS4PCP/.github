# CDSS4PCP

Our investigation team develops publicly accessible, reusable, and machine-interpretable clinical decision support system (CDSS) rules by leveraging an upper-level ontology for CDSS. We developed CDSS modules, including the routine CDSS function and functionalities for CDSS rule management and maintenance. We implemented the module in OpenMRS and demonstrated the functionality through CDS rules for CDC-recommended immunization schedules. Our efforts will save duplicate work by multiple stakeholders of CDS rules and establish a critical foundation for achieving interoperability for individualsâ€™ immunization records. Our investigation also aims to enable primary care providers, especially those in small primary care practices, to manage and maintain CDS rules independently, keeping CDS updated, valid, and working to its full potential, thereby benefiting the large population served by such practices. On this page, we share the CDSS rules in multiple formats, including clinical quality language rules (CQL), CDSS modules (common and adaptor for OpenMRS), a CQL rule testing module, and an active learning pipeline that facilitates manual ontology construction and maintenance.
